<h1 align="center">Test Plugin</h1>
This is the minimal code for a Sedeen plugin. Use CMake to configure the build. Visual Studio or another build system can be used to compile the generated project. Note that the project must be compiled in Release mode to be used as a plugin in a Sedeen Viewer installation. Build the INSTALL target to copy the .dll and .info file to the plugins directory of the Sedeen Viewer.
